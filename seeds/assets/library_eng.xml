      <title>Genesis 39</title>
      <highlight verse="1">And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="2">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="9">And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="14">And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="13">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="13">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</highlight>

      <title>Isaiah 56</title>
      <highlight verse="1">Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="7">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="32">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="34">And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="35">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="21">And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="20">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="27">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="28">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="29">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="30">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="31">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</highlight>

      <title>Acts 9</title>
      <highlight verse="1">And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And the apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="12">And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="54">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="55">O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="56">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="57">But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="58">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</highlight>
