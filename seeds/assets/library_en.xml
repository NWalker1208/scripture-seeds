      <highlight verse="14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</highlight>
