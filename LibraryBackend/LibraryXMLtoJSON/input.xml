      <title>Genesis 39</title>
      <highlight verse="1">And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="2">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="9">And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="14">And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="13">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="13">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</highlight>

      <title>Isaiah 56</title>
      <highlight verse="1">Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="7">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="32">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="34">And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="35">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="21">And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="20">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="27">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="28">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="29">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="30">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="31">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</highlight>

      <title>Acts 9</title>
      <highlight verse="1">And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And the apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="12">And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="54">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="55">O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="56">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="57">But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="58">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="9">And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would speak in other words—they set him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="4">For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement—save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="4">Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</highlight>

      <highlight verse="7">Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father—that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?</highlight>

      <highlight verse="4">For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="20">And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And there were exceedingly many prophets among us. And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.</highlight>

I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="33">For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="36">And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom’s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved—</highlight>
      <highlight verse="37">I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="13">And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="2">And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth.

      <highlight verse="12">And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which are in the water under the earth.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">Thou shalt not kill.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="27">And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="28">And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="29">And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="30">Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="31">But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="32">And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="7">And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="12">And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</highlight>

      <title>Mosiah 27</title>
      <highlight verse="18">And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength—that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="25">And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="27">I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="28">Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="29">My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="30">I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="31">Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="32">And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites—</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="44">Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="45">Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="4">Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?—for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="8">And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="14">And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="25">And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="26">And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe—that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="27">Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="16">And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="1">And it came to pass that as the disciples of Jesus were journeying and were preaching the things which they had both heard and seen, and were baptizing in the name of Jesus, it came to pass that the disciples were gathered together and were united in mighty prayer and fasting.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="2">And Jesus again showed himself unto them, for they were praying unto the Father in his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and said unto them: What will ye that I shall give unto you?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="3">And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And the Lord said unto them: Verily, verily, I say unto you, why is it that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="6">And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="7">Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my sake.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses’ name then it be Moses’ church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name; therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my name the Father will hear you;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="28">And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say unto you, whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name shall be given unto you.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="14">And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil—</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="18">And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, because of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="19">And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="20">Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="31">And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="32">And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="33">And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="34">And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="35">And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="36">Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="37">Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="38">For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="39">But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="8">Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done away in me.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach—repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="12">But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!</highlight>

      <highlight verse="20">And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;</highlight>
      <highlight verse="21">And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="22">And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</highlight>
      <highlight verse="23">For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father—</highlight>
      <highlight verse="24">That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="12">Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="13">Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another—that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:</highlight>
      <highlight verse="15">And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers—that they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="16">And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:29: Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="17">And again, in connection with this quotation I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especial manner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, last chapter, verses 5th and 6th: Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="18">I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other—and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</highlight>

He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord’s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum.

      <highlight verse="3">And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?</highlight>
      <highlight verse="4">And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="5">Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="8">And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled and wondered.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his glory was not upon Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="10">And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="11">But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him.</highlight>

      <highlight verse="5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;</highlight>

      <highlight verse="7">And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="8">And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man whom I had formed.</highlight>
      <highlight verse="9">And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also a living soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</highlight>
